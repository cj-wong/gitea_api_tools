# Get Deploy Keys

## Overview

This script gets a list of your deploy keys alongside what repositories they're used in. Additionally, the script will show the public key with the fingerprint. Additionally, normally in the web interface, Gitea does not show the public key once it's been added.

## Usage

The script takes or uses no arguments.
