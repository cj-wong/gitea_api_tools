# Get Deploy Keys

## Overview

This script gets a list of your deploy keys (with their respective fingerprints) alongside what repositories they're used in.

Note: normally in the web interface, Gitea does not show the public key once it's been added, only the fingerprint.

## Usage

The script takes or uses no arguments.
